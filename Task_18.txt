For each of the following examples describe at least one possible input and output:

○ A self-driving car
Inputs include information from cameras and sensors, as well as the driver's response while in
control of the vehicle, how far away from a sensed hazard they start to break for example.
Output is how the car is driven in autopilot mode, how far away from the vehicle ahead it stays,
its speed and when it starts warning the driver to break.

○ Netflix recommendation system
The inputs are what a viewer is watching, what they choose next, and whether they watch it all
or stop halfway through. The output is what Netflix recommends next. This output is based on
the input information; what other people who watched the same shows previously also watched.

○ Signature recognition
The input in signature recognition is the signatures and a person’s evaluation of whether they
are the same or not. The output will be a decision on whether two signatures match, which have
not been verified by a person.

○ Medical diagnosis
The input in this case is information on symptoms the program is given, as well as any other test
results. It also must be supervised, have input of what the symptoms are of different medical
conditions and their treatments. The output would be a prediction of a medical condition and any
sugested treatment.
